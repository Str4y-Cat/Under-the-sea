# Octree Data Structure for 3D Scene Rendering

This JavaScript project implements a basic octree data structure for efficient 3D scene rendering on the web.

## Features

- Efficient spatial partitioning of 3D objects.
- Improved rendering performance by reducing object processing.
- Dynamic insertion and deletion of objects.
- Customizable parameters like depth
- Debug view 

## To Improve

This is a very basic implementation. It's built specifically to improve raycasting perfomance(improves best and average case. Worst case, O(N) remains the same) in three.js. 
I would like to optimize my search functions.
I also need to add delete fucntionallity.
